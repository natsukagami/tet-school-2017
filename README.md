### Naming Convention

Suppose a problem named `PALIN` given by Duy on 2017/Jan/15, the editorial link should be `20170115/Duy/PALIN.md`.

If the problem comes from LAH the link should be like `20170115/LAH16/ROPE.md`.

Code, if included, goes into `20170115/Duy/PALIN.cpp`.

If the problem source is from an online link, it should be included in the editorial.

Else, should it be `20170115/Duy/PALIN.pdf` or such.
